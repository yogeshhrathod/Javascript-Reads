### **JavaScript Security: Advanced Concepts**

---

#### 1. **What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?**  
**Content Security Policy (CSP)** is a security feature that helps prevent a range of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. It allows web developers to control which resources can be loaded and executed on their website, thereby preventing malicious content from executing.

- **Example:**  
A basic CSP header might look like this:
```javascript
// Set CSP header to only allow scripts from the same origin and disallow inline scripts
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
```

This header prevents:
- Loading scripts from external sources (except from the same origin).
- Inline JavaScript execution.
- Embedding Flash or other plugins.

#### 2. **What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)?**  
**CORS** is a mechanism that allows web applications running at one origin (domain) to request resources from another origin. By default, web browsers block cross-origin HTTP requests for security reasons. CORS is a way to allow such requests securely.

- **Example:**  
A CORS header in the server response:
```javascript
// On the server (Node.js example with Express)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); // Allow requests from any origin
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
  next();
});
```
This will allow any domain to access the resources from this server. You can limit it to specific domains for better security.

---

#### 3. **What is HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)?**  
**HSTS** is a security feature that forces browsers to only communicate with a site over HTTPS (secure connection) instead of HTTP. It helps protect websites from downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

- **Example:**  
To implement HSTS, you can send the following header from the server:
```javascript
// On the server (Node.js with Express)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.setHeader('Strict-Transport-Security', 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains');
  next();
});
```
This header tells browsers to only access the site over HTTPS for the next 1 year (`max-age=31536000`), including all subdomains (`includeSubDomains`).

#### 4. **What is Clickjacking?**  
**Clickjacking** is an attack where a user is tricked into clicking something different from what they think they are clicking. It’s often done by overlaying a transparent iframe over a legitimate webpage. This can lead to actions being performed without the user's knowledge.

- **Prevention (X-Frame-Options):**  
You can prevent clickjacking by setting the `X-Frame-Options` header:
```javascript
// On the server
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```
This prevents your website from being embedded in an iframe altogether.

---

#### 5. **What is Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)?**  
**XSSI** is a type of attack where sensitive data is exposed by embedding JavaScript code that fetches the data. The attacker can hijack this data by including it in their own website.

- **Prevention:**  
To prevent XSSI attacks, you can add a `JSON` response header to your server responses to ensure they’re handled as pure data:
```javascript
// On the server
response.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
```
Also, ensure that sensitive data is never exposed directly in JavaScript files.

#### 6. **What is Secure HTTP Headers?**  
HTTP headers are a powerful tool for controlling security behaviors. Some key headers for improving security are:

- **`X-Content-Type-Options`**: Prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type.
- **`X-XSS-Protection`**: Enables or disables cross-site scripting filters in the browser.
- **`Referrer-Policy`**: Controls how much referrer information should be sent with requests.
  
**Example (setting headers):**
```javascript
// On the server
response.setHeader('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
response.setHeader('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
response.setHeader('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
```

#### 7. **What is the `Subresource Integrity` (SRI) in JavaScript?**  
**SRI** is a security feature that allows browsers to verify that files hosted on third-party servers have not been tampered with. It works by generating a cryptographic hash of the resource, which is then included in the HTML `<script>` or `<link>` tag.

**Example (using SRI with a CDN script):**
```html
<script src="https://example.com/some-library.js" integrity="sha384-oqVuAfXRKap7fi1oK7W3o2Q6g5AGIY7j1Fwp+d6gx1gdFIIw0W2oJ0Hym+kqz0I" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### 8. **What is Tokenization and Why is it Important in Security?**  
**Tokenization** is a process of replacing sensitive data (such as credit card numbers) with randomly generated tokens that have no meaningful value outside the context of the system. Tokenization reduces the risk of data breaches.

**Example:**
Instead of storing the real credit card number, you store a token:
```javascript
const token = generateTokenFromCreditCard(cardNumber);  // Replace real card number with a token
```

Only the server with the tokenization system can map tokens to the real data.

---

#### 9. **What is the Same-Origin Policy (SOP)?**  
The **Same-Origin Policy** is a critical security feature implemented by web browsers that prevents web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page, unless explicitly allowed (e.g., through CORS headers).

- **Example:**  
A script on `example.com` cannot make an AJAX request to `anotherdomain.com` unless `anotherdomain.com` allows it via CORS headers.

---

#### 10. **How to Prevent Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)?**  
**IDOR** occurs when an attacker can manipulate URL parameters (such as user IDs or file names) to access unauthorized resources. To prevent IDOR:
- Validate user input.
- Implement access control checks based on user roles.

**Prevention Example:**
```javascript
// On the server
function checkUserPermissions(userId, requestedId) {
  if (userId !== requestedId) {
    throw new Error("Access Denied");
  }
}
```
